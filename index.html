            <p>Qinni first got attention for her artwork on the website DeviantArt back in 2008. Over the years, her anime-inspired art has captured the hearts of millions, giving her the confidence to pursue a career out of it.</p>
           
            <p>Qinni started professionally by working as a background painter for animation studio Titmouse. In her spare time, she also continued doing tutorials and mentored other artists online. </p>
           
            <p>It did not take long for her to become influential in the art world, accumulating over two million followers on Instagram. Beyond Instagram, Qinni's work has been widely shared by millions more online.</p>
           
            <p>The online art community has come to know Qinni not only for her remarkable talent but also for her kindness and positive vibe. She was even recognized by Deviantart for “helpfulness and mentoring within the DeviantArt community” with the DeviantArt's Deviousness Award in 2017.</p>
           
            <p>Qinni has previously revealed her genetic heart condition and opened up about having undergone open-heart surgery multiple times. Just after Christmas, she also announced that she had been diagnosed with terminal stage 4 fibrosis sarcoma cancer. Her doctor said that she had <em>“a year or year and a half left.”</em> 
            </p>
           
            <p>Despite the diagnosis, which sparked an outpouring of sympathy from her fans, Qinni continued making art.</p>
           
            <p>Fellow artist Courtney “Seage” Howlett shared the heartbreaking news of her death on February 10.</p>
           
            <p>DeviantArt posted a tweet on February 10 celebrating Qinni's work: “Today, the world has lost a wonderful artist, and a wonderful person. Thank you for inspiring us with your art, Qinni. We hope you rest in peace.”</p>
